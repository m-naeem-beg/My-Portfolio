We will focus on the GPA data you provided for courses related to different programming languages. Here's a summary:

### Course GPAs:
- **C Language:**
  - Theory: 3.0/4.0 (3 Credits)
  - Lab: 3.25/4.0 (1.5 Credits)

- **Data Structures in C++:**
  - Theory: 2.75/4.0 (3 Credits)
  - Lab: 3.25/4.0 (1.5 Credits)

- **Algorithms in C++:**
  - Theory: 3.0/4.0 (3 Credits)
  - Lab: 2.5/4.0 (1.5 Credits)

- **OOP in Java:**
  - Theory: 3.0/4.0 (3 Credits)
  - Lab: 4.0/4.0 (1.5 Credits)

### Calculating the Weighted GPA:
1. **C Language:**
   - Total Credits: 4.5
   - Total Grade Points: (3.0 * 3) + (3.25 * 1.5) = 9 + 4.875 = 13.875
   - GPA: 13.875 / 4.5 = 3.0833

2. **Data Structures in C++:**
   - Total Credits: 4.5
   - Total Grade Points: (2.75 * 3) + (3.25 * 1.5) = 8.25 + 4.875 = 13.125
   - GPA: 13.125 / 4.5 = 2.9167

3. **Algorithms in C++:**
   - Total Credits: 4.5
   - Total Grade Points: (3.0 * 3) + (2.5 * 1.5) = 9 + 3.75 = 12.75
   - GPA: 12.75 / 4.5 = 2.8333

4. **OOP in Java:**
   - Total Credits: 4.5
   - Total Grade Points: (3.0 * 3) + (4.0 * 1.5) = 9 + 6 = 15
   - GPA: 15 / 4.5 = 3.3333

### Calculating Overall Proficiency (Weighted Average GPA):
Total Credits = 4.5 + 4.5 + 4.5 + 4.5 = 18
Total Grade Points = 13.875 + 13.125 + 12.75 + 15 = 54.75

Overall GPA = 54.75 / 18 = 3.0417

### Calculating Percentages:
- **GPA to Percentage Conversion (Assuming GPA 4.0 = 100%):**
  - C Language: 3.0833 / 4.0 * 100 = 77.08%
  - Data Structures in C++: 2.9167 / 4.0 * 100 = 72.92%
  - Algorithms in C++: 2.8333 / 4.0 * 100 = 70.83%
  - OOP in Java: 3.3333 / 4.0 * 100 = 83.33%

### Language Proficiency:
- **C Language Proficiency:** 77.08%
- **C++ Language Proficiency:** (Weighted Average of Data Structures and Algorithms)
  - (72.92% + 70.83%) / 2 = 71.88%
- **Java Language Proficiency:** 83.33%

**Overall Language Proficiency (Average of all):**
(77.08% + 71.88% + 83.33%) / 3 = 77.43%

### Summary:
- **C Language Proficiency:** 77.08%
- **C++ Language Proficiency:** 71.88%
- **Java Language Proficiency:** 83.33%
- **Overall Language Proficiency:** 77.43%

And I have completed the basic Python course from YouTube and also enrolled in the Code In Place (A course of Python Language) by Stanford University. From these I assume my Python proficiency is 72%.

These percentages give a clear picture of my proficiency in each language based on my course performance.
